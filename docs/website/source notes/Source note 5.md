**Summary**
In Vannevar Bush's article "As We May Think" he details his theoretical machine that would create permanent associative links of information. He describes a hypothetical Memex which foreshadows the [[hypertext websites]] that would come with the [[digital revolution]] and the [[internet]]. The idea behind the Memex is that if someone wanted to look through information relating to a topic they would be able to look at one pertanent piece of information and be then directed along a path that contains all relvant information on that topic. The main idea is that you would always be able retrace your steps when looking at the topic no matter how far in the future thus creating a way to store thoughts/thought trains and information forever.
