**Summary**
In his article Marco Piccolino illustrates a broad overview of [[Galvani]]'s discoverys in [[animal electricity]], while also writing about the theoretical feud that Galvani and [[Volta]] shared about their views on [[animal electricity]]. Galvani's main work the [[De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius]]*, illustrates his findings in more thatn 10 years of research on animal electricity (mostly in frogs). His theory of [[electricity]] in animals worked to disprove the common theory proposed by [[Descartes]] saying that rather than electrical pulses in animals the reason they moved as they did was due to something called "[[animal spirits]]". The fued between [[Volta]] and [[Galvani]] lead both parties to making great adavancements in the electrical field, like for example [[Volta]]'s creation of the first battery in the year 1800 while [[Galvani']]s studies laid down the foundation for [[electrophysiology]], a science which has been used more in recent times.
