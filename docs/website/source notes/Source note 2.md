**Summary**
In Peter Denning's essay he argues that [[networking]] as whole has had more of an impact on the human race than the apollo moon missions. In illustrating his point he uses the [[ARPANET]], the first wide area network established by the United States Department of Defense. He argues that the significance of the [[ARPANET]] lies in the shifts in human practices that have resulted rather than the networking in of itself. Since its creation the [[ARPANET]] has inflated to a 60,000 node network spread all over the world. It has reshaped the world of business, education, and government while proving the efficacy of [[packet-switching networks]].
