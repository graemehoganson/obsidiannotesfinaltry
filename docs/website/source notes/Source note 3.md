**Summary**
The article follows the journey from the [[internet]]s creation as a [[hub-and-spoke model]] of a military resource to its modern day indestructible [[packet-switching networks]]/model in the cold war, to its modern day pervasive medium. Secondly the article touches on the rules of communication for computers ([[protocols]]) which facilitate the control of online communication. Using the Facebook example people feel they have freedom on the site however they are only able to communicate and use the application through the [[protocols]] that have been set up by facebook itself. 

The internet was orginally made in 1973 with the U.S Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). While researching how to make computers communicate over a broad network DARPA created [[packet-switching networks]]. The internet quickly became used for sending [[e-mail]]s, incorporationg [[hypertext websites]], and ultiamtely falling victim to capitalism and becoming a for profit dreamscape for startup companies.
