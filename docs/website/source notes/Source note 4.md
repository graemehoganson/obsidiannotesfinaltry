**Summary**
In his book Coopersmith talks about the history of the [[fax machine]]. From its early beginnings in the 1840s as a different form of [[telegraph]], to its now dying yeasrs in the digital age. Faxing is seen as a technological failure, with only having great sucess in the 1980's to mid 90's where it was ultimately phased out almost entirely due to the rising of e-mail and other means brought forward by the internet. Coopersmith describes the fax's existence as "supply outpacing demand" it was a product that was designed for a market to small to schieve success. Faxing was a more costly and less efficient way of transmitting messages which meant that event at the height of its popularity it was still being outclassed by comepting technologies who would work better and for less. However, despite all of its failures in the 1980's standardization came about and the fax machine was suddenly in demand shocking advocates for the new digital technologies. Fax's success would also become its downfall though, as expectations were set high and the machines were not able to produce the expected results which competing technologies could provide while also being less expensive.
