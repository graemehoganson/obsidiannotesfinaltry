Animal spirits was a theory proposed by french philosopher Rene [[Descartes]], in whihc he hypothesized "**that animal spirits or pneuma served as the basis of nerve and muscle function**. He theorized further that the finest particles in the blood passed through the pineal gland on their way to the brain, where they turned into animal spirits". This theory was later disproved by [[Galvani]] during hios research about [[animal electricity]].
