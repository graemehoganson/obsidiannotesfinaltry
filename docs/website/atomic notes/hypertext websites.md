Hypertext websites are the groundwork for what makes up the internet since their creation. The oldest record of a hypertext existing is Vannervar Bush's theoretical Memex, which he imagined in 1945. (Hypertext is essentially all that obsidian is)

**"Hypertext** refers to the familiar action of clicking on a word (or chunk of text) to take you to another page. As a term, it was coined by [**Ted Nelson**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) in _Literary Machines_ in 1965:"
