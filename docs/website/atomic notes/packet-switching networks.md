A packet switched network (PSN) isÂ **a type of computer communications network that groups and sends data in the form of small packets**. It enables the sending of data or network packets between a source and destination node over a network channel that is shared between multiple users and/or applications. It replaced the netwroking style of the [[hub-and-spoke model]] as the hub and spoke model could be broken through removing the hub, whereas the packet switching model has each device acting as a node and thus making the system almost unbreakable.
