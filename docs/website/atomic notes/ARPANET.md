The **Advanced Research Projects Agency Network** (**ARPANET**) was the first wide-area [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network "Packet-switched network") with distributed control and one of the first networks to implement the [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP "TCP/IP") protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). The ARPANET was established by the [Advanced Research Projects Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency "Advanced Research Projects Agency") (ARPA) of the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense").
