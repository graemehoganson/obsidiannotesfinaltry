Coopersmith describes the fax's existence as \"supply outpacing demand\" it was a product that was designed for a market to small to schieve success. Faxing was a more costly and less efficient way of transmitting messages which meant that event at the height of its popularity it was still being outclassed by comepting technologies who would work better and for less. However, despite all of its failures in the 1980's standardization came about and the fax machine was suddenly in demand shocking advocates for the new digital technologies.
